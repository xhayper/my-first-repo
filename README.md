# Simple Bank Account Class

This is a basic Python project that demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) by implementing a `BankAccount` class. The class allows for creating accounts, depositing money, withdrawing money, and checking the account balance.

---

## Features

The `BankAccount` class supports the following operations:

* **Create Account:** Initialize a new account with an owner's name and an optional starting balance (defaults to 0).
* **Deposit:** Add a positive amount to the account balance.
* **Withdraw:** Subtract an amount from the balance. This action is only successful if the amount is positive and does not exceed the current balance.
* **Check Balance:** Print the account owner and current balance using a human-readable string representation.

---

## Files

* **`bank.py`**: Contains the `BankAccount` class definition, including its attributes (`owner`, `balance`) and methods (`deposit`, `withdraw`, `__str__`).
* **`main.py`**: A simple script that demonstrates how to import, create, and use an instance of the `BankAccount` class.

---

## Requirements

* Python 3.x

##  How to Use

To run the demonstration script, execute `main.py` from your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```
